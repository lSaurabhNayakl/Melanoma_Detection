# Melanoma Detection Project
> The aim of this project is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Melanoma Detection Project is an individual assignment, to create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset.
- The data set contains these diseases: Actinic keratosis, Basal cell carcinoma, Dermatofibroma, Melanoma, Nevus, Pigmented benign keratosis, Seborrheic keratosis, Squamous cell carcinoma and Vascular lesion.
- We need to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma because it accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
